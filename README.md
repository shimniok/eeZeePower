A simple, small, convenient, 3.3V/5V breadboard power module. If you're sick of hunting around for a power source for your breadboard projects and want a simple, small, 
and convenient power module, well, I feel you. Here's the solution. After you solder in the pin headers, plug in a USB mini-B cable, select 3.3V or 5V, it's time to Make while 
your pals are still trying to figure out how to wire that 9V battery to a 7805.

## Features

* Selectable 3.3V / VUSB (5V) output meets your common prototyping needs
* Maximum current of 500mA
* USB Mini-B input because we all have a gazillion of these cables
* Two sets of output pins for stable installation
* Small; only takes up a tiny corner of the breadboard
* 100uF and 0.1uF filtering capacitors on the output
* 10uF and 0.1uF filtering caps on the regulator input
* All SMT components populated
